# CCypher
This accepts a message and runs it though a Caesar Cipher based on the ROT-13 Cipher. After encoding your message the ciphertext is written to a file name 'encoded.txt'.

Caesar Cipher - emphasis on the C ðŸ™‚

Compile with: `gcc -o CCipher CCipher.c`

Use a ROT-13 decoder to decode your message.
Here's a great link for one: https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher
