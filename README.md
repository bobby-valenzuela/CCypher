# CCypher

Caesar Cipher - emphasis on the C ðŸ™‚

This accepts a message and runs it though a Caesar Cipher based on the ROT-13 Cipher. After encoding your message the ciphertext is written to a file named 'encoded.txt' in the working directory.

Compile with: 
```bash
gcc -o CCipher CCipher.c
```

Run: 
```bash
./Cipher
```
  
Use a ROT-13 decoder to decode your message.
Here's a great link for one: https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher
