# CCypher

Caesar Cipher - emphasis on the C ðŸ™‚

This accepts a message and runs it though a Caesar Cipher based on the ROT-13 Cipher. After encoding your message the ciphertext is written to a file named 'encoded.txt' in the working directory.

Compile with: `gcc -o CCipher CCipher.c`

Use a ROT-13 decoder to decode your message.
